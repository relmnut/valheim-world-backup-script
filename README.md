# valheim-world-backup-script
Welcome!
Create a world backup easily for Server Hosting or normal Player's worlds.

This script was made for Server Hosting and by someone who hasn't touched python in 5 years, please bear in mind if there is bugs :)

Dependencies:
py7zr - pip install py7zr

Open Command Prompt in Administrator and type it in.
For linux, make sure you run it as sudo pip3 install py7zr.

This was made in Python 3.8.8 but this script should work fine in 3.7
