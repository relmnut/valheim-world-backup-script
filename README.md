# Valheim World Backup Script in Python3
Welcome!
Create a world backup easily for Server Hosting or normal Player's worlds.

This script was made for Server Hosting and by someone who hasn't touched python in 5 years, please bear in mind if there is bugs :)

Dependencies:
py7zr - pip install py7zr

This script only works for Windows for now.
Open Command Prompt in Administrator and type it in.

This was made in Python 3.8.8 but this script should work fine in 3.7
